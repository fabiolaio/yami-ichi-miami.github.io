            GM. Calling all artists! The Internet Yami-Ichi is a black flea market for selling physical artwork inspired by the internet, is now accepting submissions for its upcoming event in Miami. We are seeking artists who are pushing the boundaries of AI art, physical exhibition pieces, and NFTs. 

            If you have a unique and innovative take on internet culture and want to showcase it to a wider audience, we want to hear from you. 

            If you are interested in submitting your artwork we have 3 types of submissions:

          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Artists with Physical AI Art that will be exhibited. Do you have any physical AI Art that you would like to exhibit? (not screens, we are focused in showcasing objects, paintings, photos, etc) We will have a few spots to display physical art.</li>
              <li>Artists with AI NFTS will be displayed on a screen. We will be running an AI Livestream through <a target="_blank" href="https://ai24.live">AI24</a>.</li>
              <li>Artists that want to sell physical AI artwork linked to their NFTs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have a curatorial team to decide which artwork we are going to display. Submit your work now for the chance to be a part of this exciting event! Please fill out the <a target="_blank" href="https://gzu7jtsegrq.typeform.com/to/sVOfkZCs">Typeform</a> to submit your work and keep reading for the full guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not cover the shipping of physical artwork, we promise we will take care of it, mount it and send it back (this shipping cost is also on you). We do not take any percentage of the sell, this is completely for you.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            *If you are a local artist from Miami you can submit any artwork related to the internet, if you want to make a new AI piece and you don’t know how to make any images to translate it to a physical object, please reach out and let us know!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first Yami-Ichi funded by a DAO. We want to thank <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refractionfestival.com/">Refraction DAO</a> for their support in creating this event.
