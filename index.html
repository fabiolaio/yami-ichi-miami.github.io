            GM. Calling all artists! The AI Internet Yami-Ichi is a black flea market for selling physical artwork inspired by the internet, where people deal with “Internet-ish” items in real space. We are now accepting submissions for The AI internet Yami-Ichi on <span class="bolded">March 12</span>, at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hodlergallery.com/">HODLER Gallery</a> in Miami. We are seeking artists who are pushing the boundaries of AI art with physical exhibition pieces and NFTs. 

            If you have a unique and innovative take on internet culture and want to showcase it to a wider audience, we want to hear from you.

            If you are interested in submitting your artwork we have 3 types of submissions:
